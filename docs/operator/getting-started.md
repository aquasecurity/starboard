Assuming that you installed the operator in the `starboard-operator` namespace,
and it's configured to discover Kubernetes workloads in the `default` namespace,
let's create the `nginx` Deployment that we know is vulnerable:

```
kubectl create deployment nginx --image nginx:1.16
```

When the first pod controlled by the `nginx` Deployment is started, the operator
immediately detects that and creates the Kubernetes job in the `starboard-operator`
namespace to scan the `nginx` container's image (`nginx:1.16`) for
vulnerabilities. It also creates another job to audit the pod's template for
common configuration pitfalls such as running the `nginx` container as root:

```console
$ kubectl get job -n starboard-operator
NAME                                 COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
scan-configauditreport-c4956cb9d     0/1           1s         1s
scan-vulnerabilityreport-c4956cb9d   0/1           1s         1s
```

If everything goes fine, the scan jobs are deleted, and the operator saves scan
reports as custom resources in the `default` namespace, named after the Deployment's active ReplicaSet. For image vulnerability scans, the operator creates a report for each different container defined in the active ReplicaSet. In this example there is just one container image called `nginx`:

```console
$ kubectl get vulnerabilityreports -o wide
NAME                                REPOSITORY      TAG    SCANNER   AGE     CRITICAL   HIGH   MEDIUM   LOW   UNKNOWN
replicaset-nginx-7ff78f74b9-nginx   library/nginx   1.16   Trivy     9m57s   1          33     22       86    0
```

Similarly, the operator creates a `configauditreport` resource holding the result
of auditing the configuration of the active ReplicaSet controlled by the `nginx`
Deployment:

```console
$ kubectl get configauditreports -o wide
NAME                          SCANNER   PASS   DANGER   WARNING
replicaset-nginx-7ff78f74b9   Polaris   9      0        8
```

Notice that scan reports generated by the operator are owned by corresponding
Kubernetes workloads. In our example, `vulnerabilityreports` and `configauditreports` objects
are owned by the active ReplicaSet of the `nginx` Deployment:

```console
$ kubectl tree deploy nginx
NAMESPACE  NAME                                                       READY  REASON  AGE
default    Deployment/nginx                                           -              44m
default    └─ReplicaSet/nginx-7ff78f74b9                              -              44m
default      ├─ConfigAuditReport/replicaset-nginx-7ff78f74b9          -              44m
default      ├─Pod/nginx-7ff78f74b9-l6w8p                             True           44m
default      └─VulnerabilityReport/replicaset-nginx-7ff78f74b9-nginx  -              43m
```

!!! note
    The [tree] command is a kubectl plugin to browse Kubernetes object hierarchies as a tree.

!!! tip
    You can get and describe `vulnerabilityreports` and `configauditreports` as
    built-in Kubernetes objects:
    ```
    kubectl get vulnerabilityreports replicaset-nginx-7ff78f74b9-nginx -o json
    kubectl describe configauditreports replicaset-nginx-7ff78f74b9
    ```

    - description: An issue was discovered in disable_priv_mode in shell.c in GNU Bash
        through 5.0 patch 11. By default, if Bash is run with its effective UID not
        equal to its real UID, it will drop privileges by setting its effective UID
        to its real UID. However, it does so incorrectly. On Linux and other systems
        that support "saved UID" functionality, the saved UID is not dropped. An attacker
        with command execution in the shell can use "enable -f" for runtime loading
        of a new builtin, which can be a shared object that calls setuid() and therefore
        regains privileges. However, binaries running with an effective UID of 0 are
        unaffected.

        that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative value for the 'num'

        the 'num' parameter to memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined
        behavior such as writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code
        execution. Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for program execution
        to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred.
        The dangers occur in that subsequent execution and iterations of this code will
        be executed with this corrupted data.

    - description: An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7
        memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc 2.30.9000. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7 targets
        that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative value for the 'num'
        parameter results in a signed comparison vulnerability. If an attacker underflows
        the 'num' parameter to memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined
        behavior such as writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code
        execution. Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for program execution
        to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred.
        The dangers occur in that subsequent execution and iterations of this code will
        be executed with this corrupted data.

      send HTTP requests to intranet servers, or read arbitrary files via a crafted

      that because expat already provides the ability to disable external entity expansion,
      the responsibility for resolving this issue lies with application developers;
      according to this argument, this entry should be REJECTed, and each affected
      application would need its own CVE.'

        using --with-libpam but without explicitly passing --disable-account-tools-setuid,
        and without a PAM configuration suitable for use with setuid account management
        tools. This combination leads to account management tools (groupadd, groupdel,
        groupmod, useradd, userdel, usermod) that can easily be used by unprivileged
        local users to escalate privileges to root in multiple ways. This issue became
        much more relevant in approximately December 2019 when an unrelated bug was
        fixed (i.e., the chmod calls to suidusbins were fixed in the upstream Makefile
        which is now included in the release version 4.8).

        is setuid and allows an unprivileged user to be placed in a user namespace where
        setgroups(2) is permitted. This allows an attacker to remove themselves from
        a supplementary group, which may allow access to certain filesystem paths if
        the administrator has used "group blacklisting" (e.g., chmod g-rwx) to restrict
        access to paths. This flaw effectively reverts a security feature in the kernel
        (in particular, the /proc/self/setgroups knob) to prevent this sort of privilege
        escalation.

    - description: shadow 4.8, in certain circumstances affecting at least Gentoo, Arch
        Linux, and Void Linux, allows local users to obtain root access because setuid
        programs are misconfigured. Specifically, this affects shadow 4.8 when compiled
        using --with-libpam but without explicitly passing --disable-account-tools-setuid,
        and without a PAM configuration suitable for use with setuid account management
        tools. This combination leads to account management tools (groupadd, groupdel,
        groupmod, useradd, userdel, usermod) that can easily be used by unprivileged
        local users to escalate privileges to root in multiple ways. This issue became
        much more relevant in approximately December 2019 when an unrelated bug was
        fixed (i.e., the chmod calls to suidusbins were fixed in the upstream Makefile
        which is now included in the release version 4.8).
